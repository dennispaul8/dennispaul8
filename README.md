##  Hi, I'm Dennis Ogunyemi — Frontend(Web3) Developer ![CodingGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d39b89b-40d0-4612-8bf6-5fa4161979ce)


I’m a frontend developer focused on building **web3 applications** by integrating and interacting with smart contracts on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io).

I’ve pushed real-world dApps, including:

- **Sui Faucet dApp** – "A user-friendly interface to request test tokens on the Sui network for development and testing purposes"  
- **On-chain Voting dApp** – "A frontend platform that lets users view proposals and cast votes directly on-chain"
