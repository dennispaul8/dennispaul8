##  Hi, I'm Dennis Ogunyemi — Frontend Developer

I’m a frontend developer focused on building **web3 applications** by integrating and interacting with smart contracts on the Sui blockchain.

I’ve pushed real-world dApps, including:

- **CoinTribute** - A decentralized fundraising platform built with Sui Move. 
- **Sui Faucet dApp** – A user-friendly interface to request test tokens on the Sui network for development and testing purposes. 
- **On-chain Voting dApp** – A frontend platform that lets users view proposals and cast votes directly on-chain.
