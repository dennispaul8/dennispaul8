## 👋 Hi, I'm Dennis Ogunyemi — Frontend & Web3 Developer

I’m a frontend developer and smart contract enthusiast focused on building **robust on-chain applications** using **Move** on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io).

In a short time, I’ve gone from learning Move to shipping real-world dApps, including:

- **Name Service (SuiNS-style)** – decentralized naming service  
- **Multi-seller Marketplace** – a fully on-chain marketplace with wallet integrations  
- **Batch Airdrop Contract** – mass token distribution automation  
- **On-chain Voting System** – governance and proposal management  
- **Token Modules & Mint Logic** – custom token creation and management  

All my projects are open-source and available on my GitHub: [https://github.com/dennispaul8](https://github.com/dennispaul8)
